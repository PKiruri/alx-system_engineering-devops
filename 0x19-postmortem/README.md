Root Cause and Resolution

The current server was not up to date and also had plenty of limitations. Due to an increase to accommodate more people and add other features to the companyâ€™s network such as remote access, host data collection space, hub e-learning courses and also incorporate an internal email and messaging platform, the company thought it was best to upgrade the server hence the downtime.


Corrective and Preventative Measures

Investing in multiple servers and not one and changing the architecture of the network. This will be a good approach to ensure in the future if any additional features need to be implemented then the company will take on a parallel form of server migration, ensuring the website and other company services are always present online.
